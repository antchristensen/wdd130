            <h1>Months we are active:</h1>
            <p>We are open from the months of June to september of each year</p>
            <h1>Operating times</h1>
            <p>We are typically availible from 8am-5pm Mountain time US. Please use our contact us page as we may be busy with rafting as we are out of the office multiple times a day.</p>

            <h2>How long does rafting take?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>We design each trip specifically for you and your crew. We can schedule an all day adventure or a 2-3 hour tour. We believe that each group will have different needs and want to accomidate as much as possible. It is important to let us know what you are comfortable with.</p>
            <h1>Will food/water be provided with trips?</h1>
            <p>Depends on the trip but we recommend bringing your own snacks and water for the shorter trips. We do have water and snacks for sale before you start your trip. For the longer trips we can provide an unforgettable lunch/dinner buffet with drinks for an additional cost. Please inform us if you intend to do this as we send a crew ahead of time to set up.</p>
            <h2>We work with large parties, please contact us with how many people and the dates you need: <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a></h2>
